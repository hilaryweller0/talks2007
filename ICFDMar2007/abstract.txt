Unstructured Modelling of the Global Atmosphere

Simulations of the global atmosphere for weather and climate forecasing require very fast and accurate solutions. Therefore high order finite differences on regular structured grids have traditionally been used operationally. However this precludes the use of local refinement. Techniques allowing local refinement are either too expensive (for example high order finite element techniques) or have lower order accuracy at changes in resolution (for example traditional unstructured finite volume). 

We present results of a new fast fourth order unstructured finite volume model of the shallow water equations on the globe written using OpenFOAM. The results are as accurate as equivalent spectral methods but can include local refinement. However we find that the use of local refinement of a mountain can only improve the global accuracy when using second order differencing. Fourth order differencing is not implemented at the refinement pattern and so, although the solution is more accurate over the refined mountain, after a 15 day simulations, errors from the refinement pattern accumulate and the global accuracy is infact reduced. 

This is a much more severe test of local mesh refinement for global simulation than has been presented before. But also a more realistic test if these techniques are to be used operationally. In order to improve these results we plan to implement the Thuburn and Lashley (19xx) differencing scheme on arbitrarily unstructured meshes which is efficient and does not assume a mesh structure.
